 

CICERO DE AMICITIA. 39

For my own part, out of all the things which either fortune
or nature have granted me, Ι have nothing which Ι can com-
pare with the sriendship of Scipio. In it Ι found agreement
on public affairs3 in it I found advice about my private
affair53 in it, also, Ι found reposo full of delight. Ι never
clashed with him, even on the slightest thing, as sar as I
could perceive ; I never heard anything from him which Ι
would rather have left unheard. We had one home, the
same food, and that in common 3 not only our military service,
but also our travels and country murs, were in common.
104. For what shall I say about our pursuits in always
studying and learning something? In this pursuit, re-
moved from the eyes of the people, we spent all our leisure
time. But if the recollection and remembrance of these
things had died with him, Ι could in no way bear now to
miss a man so closely bound and so very dear to me. They
are not destroyed, but are rather sostered and enlarged in my
thoughts and memory 3 and if I were altogether deprived of
them, still the mere lapse of time brings me a great consola-
tion. For at my time of life I cannot be involved much
longer now in this state of regret, and all troubles that are
short, even though they are great, ought to be endurable.

This is what I had to say about friendship. But Ι exhort
you to place virtue, without which sriendship cannot mist,
in such a place that, with the exception of virtue, you should
think nothing more excellent than friendship.
