concerning friendship. If there are any other points to be
discussed besides (and Ι believe there are many), make
inquiries, if it seems good to you, from those who argue on
those topics.

25. Fannius—But we would rather (make inquiries) of
you, although I have often made inquiries of them also, and
have listened to their diseourses, for my own part, not
unwillingly3 but the thread of your speech is something
different.

Semela—Yon would say so still more, Fannius, if you
had been present lately in the gardens of Scipio, when the

from Nature herself. For love (from which friendship has
received its name) leads the way to the union of kindliness.
Advantages, in aeed, are obtained often even by those who.
under the pretence of friendship, are courted and worshipped
to suit the occasion3 but in friendship there is no seigning or
pretence, md whatever there is is true and sinQre.
