half of our friends which we should. never perform on behalf
of ourselves l—begging and praying of an unworthy person ;
again clamouriug against a person with extra bitterness, and
attacking him with extra violence 3 things which in our own
affairs cannot be done quite with honour, are done in the
affairs of friends with the greatest honour. And there are
many circumstances in which good men take away much

:friendship must be set up, as soon as I have stated what
Scipio used chiefly to blame. He used to say that no
expression could have been found more hostile to friendship
than that of him who had said that a man ought to love* 1n
such a way as if some day he was likely toO hate. Nor,
indeed, could he be induced to believe that this, as it was
