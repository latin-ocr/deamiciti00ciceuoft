46 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

conlegio ι “college of augurs.⁷’

valitudinem: valitudo means “state of health,'’ and can be used
either for qood health or bad health. It is a colourless word, the
context deciding the meaning. Here it means ‘⁴ bad health.”

abduci debui: debui, perfect followed by pres. infin, whereas in
English “ Ι ought ” (pres.) is followed by the perfect infin. Possum,
debeo, with the perfect infin. are not allowed in Latin.

contingere: contingyo usually (not here) signifies good fortune,
accido either good or bad fortune (cp. accident in English).

filii: in old Latin, nouns in -z'us and -imn make their genitive in i.
In adjectives the double z· was used. The voc. of filius, (senius, and
proper names in -ius ends in i, as fili, qemi. See G. ξ 19.

{Q in viro: this use of in = “in the case of‚” is very
common.

ξ 10. istum quidem: Socrates, see supra ξ ’7.

CAP. III. LAEmus. You qave the true reason, Scaevola. I am
indeed troubled at the loss of my frie7z(Z; but I am consoled by the
knowleclqe that his life was αἰωνίους throuqhout, aml the last day of
it the most qloriozcs of all: death has been no missortune to him5

Scipionis desiderio: Scipionis is the objective genitive. Injuriac
Aeduorum can mean either (1) “the injuries caused by the Aedui,’'
subjective, or (2) “the injuries done to the Aedui,'' objective. The
way to tell whether a genitive depending on a noun is obj. or subj.
is—turn the noun into an active verb, and if the meaning requires
the genitive to be the subj. of the verb, it is a subj. genitive, and if
the meaning requires the genitive to be the object of the verb, it is an
object. genitive. Thus (1) = “the Aedui injure ” = subjective, (2) =
“they injure the Aedui ” = objective genitive. Below, ξ 23, in
amicorum desiderio, we have an objective genitive after desiderio.

viderint: used as an imperative = “let the wise men look out.”
Strictly it is a future perfect indice: ‘⁴ the wise men shall have con-
sidered,'' or the Wise men s ia consider by and by.⁷⁷

amico: abl. governed by orbatus, see G. g 307 ; so eqeo and careo
in the following sentence govern the ablative.

quo... decessu: quo does not go with decessu, but refers to
errore and is governed by cmm] decessu = “at the departure.”

accidisse: used in its usual sense of ill-fortune. See supra ξ 9.
amantis: pred. genitive. See supra ξ S.

g 11. cum illo actum esse praeclare : lit. = “that it has been done
Zznggufilly'jvith him,” sc. “by the gods‚’⁷ tle, “that his fate has been
