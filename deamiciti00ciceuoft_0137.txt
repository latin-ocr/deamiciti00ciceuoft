CICERO DE AMICITIA. 15

if this were so, the less resource each person thought he
possessed in himself, the more suited would he be for friend-
ship—but the fact is far otherwise.

30. For the more confidence a man has in himself, and the

more a man is so fortified with virtue and wisdom as to be in
want of nobody, and to judge that all his clements of happi-
ness depend ou himself, the more does he excel in seeking
and cultivating friendships. Why now 1 XVas Africanus 111
