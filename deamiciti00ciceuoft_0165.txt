written to meet the requirements of the various London University

All Latin and Greek Classics prescribed for London University are
translated in the Tutorz'al Series, and also edited if no thoroughly
suitable commentary has already been issued. Vocabularies in order
of the Text are prepared for Matriculation and Intermediate Arts.

'Phe expense involved in purchasing‚ for the study of short periods
of History and Literature, 3 large book which often contains a few

specially written for the purposes of the Examination. Such works
are provided in the Tutorial Series for each Intermediate Arts
Examination, and also for B.A. whenever there is a distinct want.

editions of the special subjeots prescribed by London University will
find existing in current literature.
