ῼζ But a fiattering friend can be separated and distinguished
from a true friend by the application of carefulness, just
as everything that is dyed and counterfeit can be distin—
guished from the genuine and true. An assembly which
consists of people most deficient in skill, is nevertheless wont
to jndssssfflhat difference there is between the popular dema-
gogue, me„ the fiatterer and untrustworthy citizen, on the one

the defence in that matter relied on its merits rather than on
the high influence of its advocate.
