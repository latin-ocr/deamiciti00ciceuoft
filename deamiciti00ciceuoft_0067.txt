pleasant.

accusative. The accus. is the interjectional accus. as in me miserum.

ut= ‘⁶ provided that,’' “ on the terms that.”

nimirum is derived 110111 ne and mirum: ne may stand 101 non,
so nimirum=non mirum cst=“ it is not wonderful‚” “ doubtless‚” or

strument ; mos in singjssmamrerseustom ; 111 pl. = character.
