CICERO DE Λ111101Τ1Λ. 23

Tarquinius said, when in exile, that hc knew at length what
faithful and what unfaithful friends hc had had, when he
could no longer make returns to either.5J>And yet I wonder
how a man of his well-known haughtiness and perversity
could have had any friend. And as the character of the man Ι
have mentioned was unable to procure true friends, so the
wealth of many who are very powerful shuts out faithful
friendships. For not only is Fortune herself blind, but she
generally makes those also blind whom she has embraced:
accordingly, they are -hurried away generally by disdain and
insolence, end there is nothing that is harder to endure than
the fool who is lucky. And the following, indeed, we may
see, that those who forme1ly were of an obliging character
are changed by power, office, and by good fortune· old
friendships aie despised by tliem, and new ones cherished. '
55. But what is more foolish, when men, through their,
prosperity, opportunities, and wealth have the greatest power,
than to procure all the other objects which can be procured
by money, viz„ horses, slaves, splendid garments and costly
vases, and to omit to procure friends, who are, so to speak,
the best and mos t beautiful furniture of life. For when they
procure other things they do not know for whom they may
be procuring them, nor on whose account they are toiling
(for each of those things belongs to him who has conquered
by his strength), whereas the possession of friendship remains
fixed and sure to eaffls person, so that even if those things
were to remain which are, as it were, gifts of Fortune,sti110a
life unadorned and deserted by friends could not be pleasant.
But so far on this point.

XVI. 56. But we must establish what are the limits and,
as it were, the bounds of loving in friendship. About these
limits Ι see three opinions are spoken of, none of which I
approve. One, that we should feel towards our friends
the same as we feel towards ourselves, a second, that our
goodwill towards them should answer equally in amount
and degree to their goodwill towards us3 and a third, that
a man should have the same value set on him by his friends
as he sets upon himself. 57. To none at all of these three
opinions do Ι assent. For the first is not true, that a person
should have the same feelings towards his friend as he has
