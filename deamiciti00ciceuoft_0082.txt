parasitorum: parasitus is lit. “one who eats with another‚” a
Greek word corresponding to conviva3 hence, in a bad sense, one
who by flattery and buffoonery manages to live at another's expense,

omnes comicos stultos: notice the three adjectives all together with-

lautissime : ‘¹ most splendidly.”

ξ 100. nescio quo pacto: “ I don't know by what means,’' “ some
how or other.''
