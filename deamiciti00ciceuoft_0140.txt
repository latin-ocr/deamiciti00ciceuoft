ciple would involve no fault if only we were (men) of perfect
wisdom. But we are speaking about those friends who are
before our eyes, whom we have seen, or about whom we have
heard by tradition, or who are known to our everyday life.
From this number we must take our instances, and especially
from the number of those, indeed, who approach nearest
to wisdom. 39. We see ,that Papus AEmilius was the close
friend of Luscinus (so we have heard from our fathers), twice
(they were) consuls together, twice colleagues in the censor-
ship 3 then it is handed down to memory that M'. Curius and Ti.
Coruncanius were most attached to them and to one another.
So we cannot even suspect that any one of these asked from
his friend anything that might be a violation of a pledge 01·
‘an oath, or an injury to the welfare of the state. In the case
of such men as these, what is it to the point to say the
following indeed—that he would not have obtained it if he

especially when one confesses that he has acted against the
welfare of the state for the sake of a friend. For we are
placed in such a position, Fannius and scaevola, that we
ought to look far ahead for the coming misfortunes of the
state. 'For already our custom has turned somewhat aside from
the course and career of our ancestors. 41. Tib. Gracchus
tried to seize kingly power, or, rather, he was indeed actually
king for a few months. Had the Roman people heard or seen
anything like it? that his friends and relations, following
in his steps, did—even after his death—in the case os P.
Scipio, I cannot describe without tears. We have put up
