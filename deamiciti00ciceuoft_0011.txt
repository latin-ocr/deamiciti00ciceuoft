-—0<>0—

Part I. consists of (a) Introduction, (b) Text, (c) Notes.
Part II. contains (α) Vocabularies, and (b) Test Papers.
Part III. contains a Translation.

Before commencing the ΤΕΧΤ read the INTRODUCTION, in
order to obtain a general idea of the subject-matter,
referring to it subsequently as occasion requires. In a
final reading, immediately before the examination, all
important points should be carefully committed to
memory.

In reading the TExT the chief object should be to
arrive at the meaning] with as little help as possible, while
nevertheless ensuring perfect accur-acy. There will pro-
bably occur, even in the first sentence, (a) some words
which you. do not know, and (b) some difficulty in seeing
the exact construction. For the first, turn to the
VOCABULARIEs; sor the second, to the NOTEs. H there
occur any words which you do not know and which do
not appear in the Vocabuhry, write them neatly down,
with their meaning, in a double column upon the blank
pages left for the purpose, adding genitive cases or
principal parts, Soc„ exactly as has been done in the case
of the printed words.

After doing your utmost to make out the passage in
this way, turn to the TRANSLATION and see how far you
were right. The Translation is not intended to save the
reader the trouble of making out the meaning, but to
serve as a test of his accuracy and to correct his errors.
Beginners may find such a method as this somewnat slow
