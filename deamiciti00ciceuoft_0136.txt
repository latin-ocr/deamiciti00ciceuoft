leaning of the mind, together with a certain feeling of love
rather than through the thought of how much advantage
it was likely to obtain. Its nature, indeed, can be remarked
even in certain beasts, who love their offspring up to a certain
time, and are loved by them in such a way that their feeling
is easily manifest. And this is much clearer in the case of
man, first, from the affection which exists between children
and parents, which cannot be destroyed, except by detestable
wickedness, secondly, in that a like feeling of love has
arisen, if we discovered some actual person with whose
character and nature we synipathize, because in him we seem

actual intercoursez And yet love is strengthened by the
receiving of a service, by the perception of zealous affection,
and by the addition of a close intimacy; and when these
things are joined to that first movement of the leving
heart, there begins to glow forth a certain mar fellous intensity
of kindline‘ss. But if any people think that it proceeds from
weakness, so that there may he someone through whom to
