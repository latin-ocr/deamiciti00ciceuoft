some dignities; many prefer even pleasures. Of these the
latter (pleasures) are the supreme good in the eyes of brutes 3
but the former are fleeting and uncertain, dependent not so
much on our own plans as 011 the chance of fortune. Thoso
who put the highest good in virtue decide gloriously indeed.
This very virtue both produces and upholds friendship 5
nor can friendship exist without virtue on any terms.

'LX „Now let us explain virtue according to the standard of our
ordinary life and our ordinary conversation; and let us not
measure it out, as certain learned men do, by big words. Let
us count as good men those who are considered so to be,
viz, men like Paulus, Cato, Galus, Scipio, and Philus; with
such as these our ordinary life is satisfied, and let us neglect
those who are not found anywhere at all. 22. Such friendship,
