IV.‚ (c) Chaps. V.—VII., (d) Chaps. VIII., IX„ (e) Chaps.
X.—XXVII., and these can be further subdivided.

(a) Chap. I.—Introductory. The recent estrangement be-
tween the two friends Sulpicius and Pompey brings
to the recollection of Scaevola a famous conversation
about friendship by Laelius at which he and O.
Fannius had been present. Cicero heard this con-
versation from Scaevola, and now reproduces it in

{aeliuss own wordS, and dedicates the treatise to
tticus.

(b) Chaps. II.—IV.—Fannius and Scaevola ask Laelius, who
has won the title of Wise, how he bears the loss of
his friend Scipio. Laelius replies, “ I ain grieved
personally‚ but am consoled by the knowledge that
death was no inisfortune to my friend. My friend-
ship with him is still iny greatest pride and happi—
ness.” Fannius and Scaevola thereupon ask him to
tell them the meaning, nature, and rules of friend-
ship.

(c) Chaps. V.-VII.—Laelius: For full information you had
better apply to the professors of philosophy; all I
can say is that friendship is the choicest gift attain-
able, can exist only among the good, is a oonibination
of kindliness, affection, and agreement, cannot exist
without virtue, and has many advantages ;—some of
which he enumerates. Fannius and Scaevola urge
him to continue and describe—

(d) Chaps. VIII„ IX.—The origin of frienship. Friendship
does not arise from a sense of weakness or deficiency,
or from a hope of receiving favour, but from Nature
herself, who has planted in us an innate love for our
children and also for virtue. The object of friendship
is love and not reward, but reward and profit are
incidental to friendship as a result.
