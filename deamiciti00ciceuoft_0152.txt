39 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

down as a correct principle in friendships that a certain kind
of immoderate goodwill, as it often happens, should not inter-
sere with the great interests of friends. For to return to the
myths‚ Neoptolemus could not have taken Troy if lie had
been willing to listen to Lycomedes, at whose court he was
brought up, when with many tears he tried to stop his
journey. And often important matters befall, so that we
have to part from our friends: and the man who wishes to
obstruct these important matters, because he cannot easily
endure to miss his friends, is both weak and effeminate by
nature, and, for that very reason, far from reasonable in
sriendship. 76. And so in everything you must consider
both what you would ask from a friend, and what you
would suffer to be obtained from yourself.

XXI. There is, also, a certain kind of disaster always
involved in the breaking up of sriendships—for our discourse
now is gliding from the intimacies of the wise down to
commonplace friendships. Often the saults of our friends
break out not only upon the friends themselves but also upon
strangers, and yet so that the disgrace often fiows back upon
their friends. Accordingly such friendshi ps must be allowed
to fade out by relaxing oui· familiarity‚ and, as Ι have heard
Cato used to say, are to be unsewn rather than torn asunder,
unless the fiame of some quite insupportable injury has
blazed forth so that it is neither right, honourable, nor pos-
sible that an estrangement and severance should not imme-
diately take place. 77. But if there has been a certain
change of either character or taste, as usually happens, or if
a disagreement as to parties in public affairs has intervened
-(I am speaking now, as Ι said a little while ago, not of the
friendships of the wise, but of ordinary friendsliips)-we shall
have to bcware lest not only our friendships appear to be
laid aside, but also lest enmities should appear to bc taken
up. For nothing is more disgraceful than to carry on war
with a man with whom you have lived on intimate terms.
Scipio, as you know, had removed himself from friendship
with Q. Pompeius on my account3 and on account of a
disagreement in public affairs he was estranged from my
