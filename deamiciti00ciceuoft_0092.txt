88 CICERO DE AmcrrrA.

of the younger Scipio. (2) Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, born 164 B.c.‚
tribune of the plebs in 133, brought forward a famous agrarian law
(lem Sempronia), by which certain portions of the publicus ager were
to be divided among the poorer citizens and Italians. In order to
carry this proposal, Tib. Gracchus had to move that his colleague,
the tribune Octavius, who had vetoed the law, should be deposed.
Octavius was deposed from office, and the law was passed. This
deposition was probably illegal; and as soon as his tribunate was
over Gracchus was open to attack. He accordingly became a candi-
date for the next year. During a debate in the Senate Tiberius
raised his hand to his head, to show that his head was in danger.
His enemies shouted that he wanted a crown, so as to be king over
them. Scipio Nasica called upon the consul to save the State, and
in the tumult that followed Gracchus was slain. (3) Caius Sempronius
Gracchus, the younger brother of Tib„ born about 155 Bc, quaestor
in Sardinia 126 13.c.‚ and tribune 123. While tribune he followed out
the ideas of his brother, carried an agrarian law, and made imme-
diate re-election to the tribunate legal. He was sent to Africa to found
a new colony, (Iunonia, on the site of Carthage. In 121 his enemy
Opimius was consul, and a law was proposed prohibiting the colony.
Gracchus and his friends returned to oppose the law 3 a tumult ensued‚
in consequence of which Gracchus had to fiee, and on being pur-
sued ordered his slave to kil] him.

H.

Hannibal (g 28) ε Hannibal, the famous Carthaginian general, who
defeated the Romans in several battles, especially at Lake Trasimenus
and at Cannae, 216 Bc, but was himself recalled to defend Carthage‚
and was defeated by Scipio at the battle of Zama in 202. After this
defeat he retired to the court of King Antiochus 111„ and in 190 to
the court of Prusias, king of Bithynia. The Romans demanded his
surrender, to prevent which he killed himself by poison in 183 B.c.
The Romans always regarded Hannibal as the type of cruelty and
barbarity3 but we do not know on what acts of his this reputation
rests.
