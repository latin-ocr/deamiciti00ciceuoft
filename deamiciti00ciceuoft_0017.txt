INTRODUOTION. 13

served under Scipio in Africa and Spain; he and Tib.
Gracchus were the first two men to mount the walls of
Carthage when it was captured, 146 B.c. He was a person
of great literary attainments, and among other things
wrote a history of his own times. His character appears
to have been somewhat stern.

(2) Mucius Scaevola, another son-in-law of Laelius,
was born about 157 B.c., and was Praetor of Asia in
121 B.C. On his return to Rome he was prosecuted for
extortion in his province, but was acquitted. He lived to
a great age—was certainly alive after 88 B.o. His family
had produced a series of great lawyers, among whom he
himself was not the least renowned. When Cicero assumed
the toqa virilis his father took him to Scaevola, from
whose side the future orator never willingly departed.
This Scaevola is generally spoken of as the Augur, to dis-
tinguish him from his namesake, the Pontifex, as to whom
see Appendix,

§4 Sources of the Treatise.—There is probably very
little original thought in the De Amicitia. Cicero has for
the most part merely put into the mouths of Roman
speakers ideas which he has adapted from Greek writers.
In the treatise Peri Philias (περὶ φιλίας) of Theophrastus,
in the Lysis and also in the Theaetetus of Plato, in Bk. viii.
of the Nicomachean Etltics of Aristotle, in the Memora-
bilia of Socrates by Xenophon, and in some fragments of
a philosopher named Chrysippus (fl. third century Bo),
many similarities of thought and expression can be found,
and there can be but little doubt that Cicero was acquainted
with all these books, and, with them as a foundation, built
up the edifice of his arguments in the De Amicitia. In
Cicero's time a Roman writer was ashamed to show too
close an acquaintance with Greek literature, and this,
perhaps, is the reason why he does not mention his
authorities as much as we should otherwise expect.

ξ 5. Brief Analysis of the Argument.—The treatise
may well be divided into the portions marked out by
Cicero through the interposition of remarks by Scaevola
and Fannius, i,e. into portions (a) Ghap. L, (b) Chaps. ΙΙ.-
