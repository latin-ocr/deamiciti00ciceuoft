 

noras. 71

Catonem dicere: if the meaning had been ‘⁸ as 1 have heard Cato
say,” we should have had dicentem, not dicere: reading dicere we
must translate ⁴‘ as I have heard that Cato said.’'

1 exarserit: from exardesco, not exardeo, which is only found in
ate Latin.

faciunda: the old form of facienda3 cp. eundus from eo. So
lequndus was the old form of Zeqendus.

ξ 77. rei publicae partibus: “ political factions.''

quocum: v. l. quicum, quo and qui being both ablatives and the
cum being placed after the pronoun instead of before3 see supra ξ 2.

meo nomine = “ on my account.'’ Pompey had promised Scipio
to give way to Laelius and not to compete with him for the consul—
ship. In spite of this Pompey carried on a secret canvaSS, and so lost
the friendship of Scipio.

auctoritate: this reading neither makes good sense nor good
grammar. We should expect an adjective to qualify it. A preferable
reading is ac moderate, but if auctoritate is kept, we must translate
“ with his usual high character.''

offensione animi: offensio = (1) “ a tripping‚’' “ stumbling ’'; (2)
an offence given to any one, hence “ disgust,‘⁷ “ aversion ⁷⁷ : (3) an
offence which one receives, hence ‘⁶ vexation,‘' “ annoyance '’ ; hence
offensione animi non acerba, lit. = “with a not-bitter vexation of
heart,'' i.e‚ ‘⁸ with vexation but without bitterness.'’

ἓ 78. danda opera est: “ pains must be taken '’ ; see§ 72 and ξ 51.
It is followed by oze fiant, and also ut videantur.

extinctae potius quam oppressae: “ to have died out rather than
to have been crushed out.” For the difference between potius and
mayis, see note on ξ 27.

ut is in culpa sit, &c.: “ that the man who does the wrong, not
the man who suffers it, shall be considered in fault ’' 3 i.e. when an
injury has been done by a former friend, if a man retaliates he puts
himself in the wrong, whereas if he submits to the injury he puts
the former friend in the wrong. The claims of former friendship
prevent a man from retaliating.

omnino: ‘⁶ on the whole,'’ “in short.”
ut ne . . . neve : see supra, ξ 42.

ξ79. quibus in ipsis: quibus can be either dat. (“t0 whom ther
is in themselves ”) or the abl.

omnia praeclara rara: this is a proverb, and we may notice
(1) the jingle (praeclara rara), cp. ἓ 64, “amicus certus in re
ἒιέοξᾶξιαὶ cernitur,’² and (2) the conciseness as shown by the omission
