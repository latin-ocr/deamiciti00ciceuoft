44 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

verb should be in the subj.‚ but the combination came to be looked
upon as a pronomina] phrase which does not affect the mood of the,
following verb. See G. ξ 623. pacto : abl. of pactum, from paciscor,
“to agree,⁷⁷ “ bargain.'’

§IL tum: at the end of 45 B.c., or beginning of 44. The “De
Senectute '⁷ was written immediately before the “ De Amicitia.”

Tu velim avertas: avertas is in the subjunctive, as if governed by
an ut which may be understood after velim. In Cicero, when volo is
followed by a subjunctive, the ut is seldom expressed, and the pro-
noun of the subjunctive is placed before the part of volo.

socerum: ¹i.e.‚ C. Laelius.

te ipse cognosces: notice the idiomatic use of ipsc agreeing with
the subject of cofflzosces, where in English we should have expected
the accusative ipsum. Cicero here compliments his old friend

§sn Sunt ista: “those statements of yours are so,’.’ ie. “are
true.’⁷ So the imperative esto = “be it so,” is the same as verum
esto = “let it be‚’⁷ or “ suppose it to Be true.’'

hoc modo : morlo here is an adverb = ‘⁶ recently.’'

alio quodam modos: modo is here a noun. The adverbial use is
derived from the meaning “limit‚'⁷ “measure ’⁵ = “by measure,”
hence Ξ “only,'’ “recently.’' quodam: Cicero uses quidam like

quasi and tanquam, to show either that the word he employsv does

not strictly express his meaning, or else that he is employmg it in a

Acilius, Cato: the construction is here changed from an acc. with

the infin. govorned by scimus into an independent indie, appellatus
