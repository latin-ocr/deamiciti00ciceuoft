tribunus pL: the tribuni plebis were Officers instituted after the

was increased to ten. The chief power of the tribunes lay in their
veto (intercessio), by means of which they could prevent the passing
of any decree by the senate, or any action of a magistrate. They
took the initiative in proposing laws at the Comitia Tributa, they
had the right of being present in the senate without being members,
and eventually, in 131 13.c., they became members of that body.
