whence he was called AfricanuS‚ or Africanus Minor, to distinguish
him from his adopted father who was also called Africanus. He was
censor 142, and accused of treason in 139 but acquitted. In 133 he
finished the Numantian War (whence he is sometimes called Numan-
tinus). On his return to Rome he opposed the democratic party and
expressed approval of the death of Tib. Gracchus, his brother-in-law.
In B.c. 129 he was found dead in bed on the morning after he had
made a speech against Gracchus’ Agrarian LaW‚ and the tribune
Carbo was suspected of his murder. Laelius was a bosom friend of
this Scipio, and the dialogue contained in this treatise “ De Amicitia,‘’
is supposed to take place a few months after Scipio's death.
