tribunatu: as a matter of fact, C. Gracchus was not Tribune until
123 B.c., six years after the date of this dialogue, so there is possibly

the proper age, and also such as to make men speculate upon the
results of his tribuneship.

serpit: lit. “ creeps‚” i.e., ‘⁶ makes imperceptible progress.’'

deinde : the exact meaning of this word (“ in the second place ’‘)

“tablet '’ ; hence “ a voting tablet '’ ; hence “ voting,” “ ballot.'⁷
