freedom. Let the authority of friends who give good 0011115οῙ
have the greatest weight in friendship‚ and let it be applied
for the purpose 01 giving advice, not only openly, but even
earnestly, if the matter so demand, and when it is applied
let it be obeyed. 45. For I think that certain men, who I
hear were regarded as wise in Greece, held asdogmas certain
strange (paradoxes>—by the way, there is nothing which they
do not follow up with their subtleties—some (of them saying)
that excessive friendships are to be avoided, lest it should be
necessary sor one person to be anxious on behalf 01 several 3
each man has enough for himself, and more than enough, 01
1115 own affairs. It is a n isance to be too much involved in
the affairs of strangers. s It is most convenient to keep the

world when they take away from 1110 friendship, than which
we have no better or ¹more pleasing (gift) from the immortal
Gods. For what is that freedom from 00102 01 enticing
appearance, indeed, but in reality to be rejected on many
grounds. For it 15 1101 consistent (with your other conduct)
