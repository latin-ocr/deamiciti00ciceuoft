50 cronno ms AMICITIA.

cria. V. Lamus. Yon had better ask'the professors of philosophy,
who will answer you more reaclily than Ι can. All Ι will say is
that friendshz'p is preferable beyond everythiny. It can eaeist only
arnono the qood, ancl is ‘in accordance with venture, which has made
us social beinys. Ι clo not admit that only the “wise ’‘ are qood.
These who possess the ordinary virtues, such as justice and qenerosity,
ancl are free from vices, are to bc called qood. In order to constitute
friendship qood-will must Μίδα the fact of relationship remains
whether qood-will ewists or not.

ξ 17. quamvis subiti: quamvis in Cicero can be used either as an
adv. = “however‚’' “ as much as you please,” or as a conj. The
conj. quamvis governs the subjunct.‚ while quanquam governs the
indic.

magnum opus est: opus, -eris, n., strictly means work, hence
opus est mihi qloclio z ‘⁶ I have work (to do) with a sword,⁷’ i.e. “ I

have need of a sword.⁷⁷ Hence opus est with the abl. came to be
used idiomatically for ‘⁴ to be in need of.”

censeo petatis: petatis is in the subjunctive depending on censeo,
just as if the latter verb had been followed by ut. Similarly, ut is
sometimes omitted after curo, caveo, sino, hortor, necesse, dcc.

ξ 18. id: this refers to “ nisi in bonis amicitiam esse non posse.”

subtilius: comp. of subtiliter, adv„ used here without an obJ'ect
Edbiffltlffffirison' z “more subtly than is needed‚’' ‘¹ with too much

ad vivum reseco: “ cut back to the quick‚'' an obvious metaphor
= “to penetrate deep into a thing.'’ The English word “quiek,’'
‘⁴ living ’' (0.9. “the quick and the dead ”) gives the same idea.

quemquam: qnisquam 01· ullus, and not quilibet or quii-is, must be
used in negative and comparative sentences, and interrog. sentences
expecting the answer ‘⁴ n0.”

sapientiae nomen: notice the genitive sapientiae where we might
expect an acc. in apposition with nomen, = “the word wisdom.''
Cp. amicitiae nomen, infra, ξ 19. On the other hand, “the city of
Rome ” in Latin is Urbs Roma.

concedant ut: we should expect the acc. and inf. instead of ut
and the subjunctive. The nt construction brings into prominence
the result rather than the fact of the admission. ‘¹ Make an admis—
sion such that the result would be,'’ διο. We may compare also
verum esse ut, ξ 50, and spem afferunt ut, ξ 68.

ξ 19. pingui, ut aiunt, Minerva: ‘⁶ with our own dull wits, as the
proverb says.'' Minerva is looked upon as Wit or Intelligence per·
sonified. Pinariis z “ fat‚⁷’ “ slow,'' “ dull.’' Besides pinqui
Minerva, we find crassa Minerva, and ‘invita Minerva. Aiunt, ut
aiunt, quod dicitur, ut dicitur are all used to introduce a proverb.
