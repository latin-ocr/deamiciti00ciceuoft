agreement in tastes, pursuits, and sentiments. Accordingly,
Ι am not so much delighted by my reputation for wisdom>
which Fannius just mentioned (especially as it is false), as by
the fact that I hope the memory of our friendship will be
eternal; and this is the more to my mind because, out of all
the ages, scarcely three or four pairs of friends are mentioned
by name, and in this class I seem to hope that the friend—
ship of Scipio and Laelius will be known to posterity.

16. Fannius—'What you say, Laelius, is necessarily so,
But since you have made mention of friendship and we are
at leisure, you will confer a great favour on me, and Ι hope
also on Seaev01a‚ if, as you are wont (to do) about other matters
when questions are put to you about them, you will state
for discussion what your opinion is about friendship, of
what kind you think it to be, what instructions you give

so if I had confidence in myself. For both the subject is
splendid and, as Fannius has said, we are at leffium. But

you mention rs one peculiar to philosophers‚ and that, too, to
Greeks, that a subject should be proposed to them to argue
about, no matter how suddenly. It is a great task, and needs
no little practice. WVheresore Ι think you should seek the
points capable of discussion in friendship from those who
make those things their profession. Ι can only exhort you
to prefer friendship beyond all things human: there is nothing
so adapted to nature, so suitable for either prosperity or ad-
versity.'= . But, first of all, I feel this, that i'riendship cannot
subsist except among good people. Nor do Ι probe the
question to the quick, like those who discuss these (points)
with too much subtlety‚ perhaps with truth‚ but with little
result to the general good3 for they say that no one but a wise
man can be a good man. Let that be so by all means 3 but
they understand by wisdom a thing which no mortal as yet
has obtair ed, whereas we ought to contemplate those things
