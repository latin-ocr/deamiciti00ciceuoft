qualis et quanta: “the nature and greatness‚’⁷ lit., “of what
kind and how great.’‘ Notice how these relative adjectives can be
translated by nouns.

alter idem: “a second sels '’; lit., “another same.'' For the
idea, cp. ἓ 23.

ξ 81. bestiis volucribus: bestiis is a noun, and is followed by five
adjectives agreeing with it; volucribus, nautibus, agrestibus describe
the abode of the beast (air, water, or land), and cicuribus, feris
describe the nature (tame or wild).

ut se: this ut depends on apparet.

anquirit: ‘⁴ seeks all round for'’; au is from the same root as
ambi, “ on both sides‚'’ “ around ” (8.9. ambio) and ἀμφί (amphi) =
“ around ” in Greek.

a person with a disposition the opposite of their owu, cy. a bad mari

ἓ 83. adjutrix: Cicero is fond of forming these fem. nouns ex-
