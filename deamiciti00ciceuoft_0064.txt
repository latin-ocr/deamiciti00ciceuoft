60 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

patriae injuriam: subJ'ective genitive.

xx annis : Themistocles fought at Salamis 13.c. 480, was ostracised
in 471. Coriolanus, threatened by the plebeiam, took refuge with
the Volscians B.c. 491.

conscivit: conscisco primarily means “to appi-ove of,” “decree
something in common’'; hence “to adjudge to‚'’ or “to inflict
upon '⁸2 mortem sibi consciscere = “to inflict death on one⁷s sels '’
= “to commit suicide.'’ It is doubtful whether either Themistocles
or Coriolanus committed suicide. Thucydides makes Themistocles
die a natural death, and Livy does not assert that Coriolanus com-
mitted suicide.

ξ 43. supplicio : supplicium is a stronger word than poena.
ut ne quis: see ξ 42, also ἓ 24.

ve13 see supra, ξ 41.
haud scio an: see supra, ξ 20.

minori curae: predicative dat. ; see G. ξ 297.

off. XIII. Ask houourable acts from friends, do honourable acts
for friends, aud yive qood advice without the sliyhtest hesitation or
reluctarice. Give rio heed to the paradoxas of certain philosophers
(1) that excessivo friendships are to be avoided; (2) the reius of
sriendship are to be kept Zoose, so that you can tiqhteu or stachen
thern when you please; (3) the source of friendship is not affection,
but a desire sor protection. Frieudship must not, <my more than
virtue, be avoided ori account of the trouble to which it qives rise.

ξ 44. adhibitae pareatur: cp. ξ 41, iis resistatur.

ξ 45. quibusdam: the allusion here is not quite definite. Probably
it is to the Epicuream.

quibusdam placuisse : ‘⁴ (that) it pleased certain persons‚’' but the
sense is stronger in Latin. Cp. senatui placet, “the senate resolves.”
Hence “certain persons have held as dogmas.’²

mirabilia: “ extraordinary opinions,’' “ paradoxes.’'
argutiis: v.l. orontius, the compar. adv.

partim: this refers to quibusdam = “ some think.” The correla-
tive to partim should be another partim, but instead of it we have
alios, in alios dicere aiunt.

t· {diducam adducere = “to pull towards one’s self”; hence “to
lg en.''

caput: lit. ‘⁶ the head '⁷ ; hence = “ the chief or principal thing.''
