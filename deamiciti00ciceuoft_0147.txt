man to whom he thinks he may possiblybe hostilez Nay, more ;
it will be even necessary to desire and pray that his friend
may sin as often as possible, so that he may give him the
more handles, as it were, by which to catch hold of him, and,
on the other hand, it will bo necessary to be troubled, pained,
and envious at the good deeds and advantages of our friends.

60. Wherefore this doctrine, indeed, whose soever it is,
amounts to doing away with friendship3 the following ought
rather to have been the doctrine—to apply such carefulness
in acquiring our friends as never, at any time, to begin to
love a person whom we should be able to hate some time
or other. Nay, more 3 if we had been unfortunate in loving,
Scipio used to think, wo ought rather to endure this than to
think about an opportunity sor enmities.

XVII. (31. So I think we must employ such limitations
(of friendship) that, when the character of friends is
saultless, there should be between them a complete com-
munity of property, plans, and wishes, so that, even if it
should happen by some chance that the wishes of our friends,
when not quite just, have to be aided, wishes in which their
standing or reputation is at stake, we must deviate from the
road, provided only if no very deep disgrace is the con-
sequence 3 for there is a limit to which indulgence can
be extended in friendship. Nor, indeed, must we neglect
reputation‚ nor ought we to to consider the goodwill of our
fellow-citizens an unimportant weapon for the conduct of
public affairs. Yet it is disgraceful to obtain their goodwill
by flattery and obsequiousness: virtue which is followed by
affection is least cf all to be rejected.

62. But Scipio used to complain (Ι often go back to him,
from whom came this whole discourse about friendship) that
in all things men were more painstaking than in sriendship.
Each man could tell how many goats and sheep he had, but
could not tell how many friends 3 and, indeed, they took
pains in procuring‘ the Yormer, but in choosing friends they
were careless, and had not, as it were, signs and marks by
which to judge those who were fit for friendship. These,
then, who are strong, steady, and consistent in character,
must be chosen3 but of this class there is a great scarcity,·
and it is difficult for anyone to judge unless he has made a.
