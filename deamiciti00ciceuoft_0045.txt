cip, I. Scaevola the auqur, from whose side Cicero when a boy
hardly ever departed, is one day speaking] about the sudden chanye in
the relations between Sulpiciusand the consul Pompeius from close
friendship into deadly enmz'ty. This reminds Scaevola of a discourse
of his father-indam, O. Laelius, concerning] fricndship which took
place in tha form of a (Italoque between the latter and his two sons-
in-law, Scaevola and Fannius, in 129 B.c.‚ just after the death of the

younqer Scipio, the bosom friend os Laelius—Dedicatc'on of Cicero’s
creatise to Atticus.

ξ 1. augur: the office of augur was one of the highest dignity at
Rome. At first there were three augurs, then four, then nine, and
from the time of Sulla fifteen. The augurs were a corporate body,
and, in case of a vacancy in their number, they themselves elected
the new member. Their duty, among other things, was to advise by
judging from the phenomena of the heavens, by the flying of birds,
by the manner in which the sacred birds ate their food, dac„ whether
an undertaking would be successful, or whether an election could
rightfully take place.

The word auqur is added to distinguish him from Q. Mucius Scae-
vola the Pontifex, mentioned below. See Biographical Index.

sapientem: Laelius is said to have received this name because he
had the good sense to withdraw an agrarian law he had proposed· as
tribune 'm 151, when he saw that to persist in it would have produced
serious riots. Probably, however, it was given to him in consequence
of his great skill and knowledge in the law.

deductus: “ introduced ”—a word used especially of introducing a
young man to a guardian or master. It was customary among the
Romans for a young man destined for a public career to live at the

house of a distinguished jurist or statesman, and there learn the
course of public business.

virili toga: the toqa virilis was first worn when a Roman youth
entered his seventeenth year. Before this age he wore the toqa prae-
texta, or purple bordered robe.
