dignity and moderation, and with seelings hurt, but not
embittered.

78. Wheresore we must take paim, first, that no severances
offriends take place3 but if anything of this kind does happen,
secondly, that the friendship should appear rather to have
died out than to have been crushed. But we must beware
lest friendships change into serious enmities, from which
quarrels, curses, and insults are bred. And yet they must
be borne if they are endurable 3 and here consideration
must be paid to a friendship of long standing, so that the
man who doesthe wrong, not the one who suffers it, may be
in the wrong. To sum up, there is one safeguard and one
precaution against all these faults and inconveniences—-not
to begin to love too quickly, and not to love the unworthy.

79. These people are worthy of friendship who have in

if it is clear in the case of all animals‚ whether they fly or
swim, whether they live in the fields, are taine or wild, first, ,
that they themselves love themselves (this feeling is born in
an equal degree with everything that breathes); and secondly„
that they seek and desire some creature of the same class of'.
animal to whom they may unite themselves (and this they,
do with a yearning and with a certain resemblance to human
love) : how much more naturally does this happen in the case
of man, who both loves himself and seeks another whose
