a friend should bc chosen who is simple-minded, sociaffle,
and sympathetie, so as to be affected by the same circum-
stances (in the same way as you are); all these qualities,
have to do with faithfulness. A nature that is shift-y and
twisting cannot be trustworthy, nor, indeed, can a man be
either trustworthy or steadfast who is not affected by the sanie
things, and naturally sympathetic. We must also add that he
should neither be pleased at bringing charges against another,
nor should he believe them when brought—qualities which
all have to do with that consistency with which I have now
for a long while been dealing. Accordingly, what Ι said at
the beginning turns out to be true, viz„ friendship can only
exist among good people. For it is the part of a good man,
whom we may also call wise, to keep in view these two
things in friendship: first (to see), that there be no sham-
ming or pretence, sor even to hate openly is more like a frank
man than to hide one's opinion under one’s looks3 secondly,
not only to repel the charges brought by anyone against a
friend, but to abstain even from being himself suspicions,
thinking that some ofl'ence has been committed by his friend.

brings with it indeed dignity, but friendship ought to be less
strict and more fine and sweet, and more inclined to all kinds
of courtesy and affability.

XIX. 67. Now there arises in this place a certain rather
difficult question, whether at any time new friends, worthy
of our friendship, are to be preferred to old, as we usually
prefer young and tender horses to old hackS. The doubt is
unworthy of a human being3 for there ought not to be any
surfeit os friendships as there is of other things. The older
’ friendship ought to be the more pleasant, just as those wines
which bear old age well. And the following saying is true,
that many bushels of salt must be eaten together that the
office of friendship may be fully carried out.

68. But new friendships, if they bring the hope that
fruit may appear, as if in blades of corn, that do not dis-
appoint··-—those new friendships are not to be rejected3 yet
an old friendship must be preserved in its own (proper)
