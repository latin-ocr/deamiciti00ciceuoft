ὃ CICERO DE AMICITIA.

whether it be that of those who used to be in this land, and
who instructed Magna Graecia (which now, indeed, is de-
stroyed, but which at that time was flourishing) in their
principles and maxims; or whether it be that of him who
was adjudged to be wisest of all men by the oracle of Apollo,
who did not hold at one time one opinion and at another
time another, as on most subjects, but always the same, viz„
that the souls of men were immortal, and that when they
departed from the body a return to heaven lay open to them,
and that it was most easy and speedy to every good and just
man.

14. This also was the opinion of Scipio, who indeed,
as if 116 had a presentiment, a very few days before his
death, when Philus and Manilius and many others were
present, and you also, Scaevola, had come with me, for
three days argued about the commonwealth. Almost the
last part of this discussion treated of the immortality of
the soul, things which he said he had heard through a
vision from Africanus in his sleep. If the truth really is
that the souls of all good men most easily fiy away in
death, as it were, from the custody and bonds of the body,
to whom do we think that the path to the Gods was easier
than for Scipio? Wherefore I sear ⁴that to mourn over what
has befallen him is more like an envious man than like a
friend. But if the former opinion is more true, that there is a.
simultaneous death of soul and body, and that no sensation
remains‚ then, as there is no good in death, so, at any rate,
there is no harm. For when sensation is lost he becomes the
same as if he had not been born at all, and yet (for the fact)
that he was born both we rejoice, and this state, so long as
it shall exist, will be glad.

15. WVherefore, as Ι said above, with him indeed fate
has acted most kindiy, but with me more unkindly, for it had
been (to my mind) fairer that as I had entered upon life
sooner so I should quit it sooner. Still, Ι enjoy the recollection
of our friendship in such a way that Ι seem to have had a happy
life because I passed it with Scipio, with whom I had a joint
care about public and private matters, with whom 1 had
both home (life) and military service in common, and—that
wherem is the whole force of friendship———the most profound
