place—for the force of age and custom is exceedingly great.
Nay, in the .case of the horse Ι113811, which I have just
mentioned, if nothing was to prevent *it‚ there is no one who
would not use one which *has become accustomed to use
more willingly than one which was unbroken and fresh.
And, indeed, not only in the case of that which is a thing of
lise, but also in the case of things which are without life,
custom has weight, since we are deiighted by those very
places, even though mountainous and wooded, in which we
have stayed for rather a long while.

(ΒΞ). But it is of the highest importance in friendship to
be ou an equality with your inferior. For there are often
certain points ot* superiority, as there were belonging to
Scipio in our flock, so to speak. He never set himself
before Philus, or Rupilius, or Mummius, or his friends 01
humbler rank. But to his brother, Quintus Maximus—an
excellent man, certainly, though by no means his equal—he
always paid respect, as to his superior, because 118 surpassed
him in years3 and he always wished that all his friends might
obtain more dignity through 1111115( And this should be done
and copied by all, viz„ to share with their friends and divide
with their connections any superiority in merit, mind, or
position, they may have acquired3 so that if they are born of
lowly parents, or if they have connections of feebler talents
or position, they may increase their wealth, and be an honour
and. pride to them. Just as in the legends those who for
some while have been counted among the household, through
ignorance of their family stock and descent, when they are
recognised and discovered to 118 the sons of either Gods orkings,
still keep their affection for the shepherds whom 101· many
years they have thought their fathers. And this certainly
should bc done much more in the case 01 our real and un-
doubted parents. For the fruit of talent and virtue, and
01 every excellence, is obtained in the greatest amount only
when it is bestowed upon all our nearest connections.

XX. 71. As, therefore, those who in the ties of sriendship
and association are superior, ought to put themselves on a level
with their inferiors, so the inferiors ought not to grieve that they
are surpassed by their friends, either in talents, position or
honours. And most of these are always making either 301118
