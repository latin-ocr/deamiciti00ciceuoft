38 CICERO DE AMICITIA. ⁵

VVherefore let us return to those first principles Ι laid down,
and let us at last form a conclusion about them.

XXVII. C. Fannius, and you, Q. Mucius, it is virtue-
virtue, I say, that both wins and preserves friendship. On
that depends harmony in all things, on that the firmness, on
that the consistency 01 011 things. And when it has raised
itself and shown its light, and has seen and recognised the
same thing in another, it moves 11301110 it, and in return
receives that which is in the 011101; hence begins the flame
of either love or friendship. Each of these two things is
named 110111 loving. Now, to love is nothing else than to
1001 0 strong regard for that very person whom you may love,
from no sense of deficiency, from no search after profit ; yet
this very profit blossoms forth from friendship, even if you
have not pursued it. 101. It was with this goodwill that
in my youth I 1ονοᾶ 111030 famous old men, L. Paulus,
M. Cato, C. Galus, P. Nasica, Ti. Gracchus, the father-in-law
of our Scipio. This goodwill shines forth still more among
persons of the same age, as between Scipio, L. Furius,
P. Rupilius, Sp. Mummius, and myself. And in turn, in my
old age 1 rest on the 0110011011 01 young nien, as on yours
aud on Q Tubero’s. For my own part, 1 am delighted
by the intimate acquaintance even< of the very youthful
P. Rutilius and A. Verginius. And since the method of our
life and nature is so arranged that one age arises out 01
another, you must indeed, most 01 all, desire to be able to
reach the goal, as they say, in the company of your con-
temporaries, with whom you set off, as it were, from the
starting-post. 102. But since the fortunes of men are frail
and perishable, we must always look round for some whom we
may love and who may love us, 101 11 you take away affec-
tion and goodwill, all pleasantness is taken away from life.
Although Scipio was suddenly snatched away, yet to me,
indeed, he lives, and always will live. For I loved that
man's virtue, and that has not been destroyed 3 and not only
is it present before the eyes of me alone, who always had it
at hand, but to posterity also it will be bright and remarkable.
No one will ever have an intention 01 hope 10 undertake tasks
greater than ordinary without thinking that he must put be-
1010 himself a remembrance and impression 01 that man. 103.
