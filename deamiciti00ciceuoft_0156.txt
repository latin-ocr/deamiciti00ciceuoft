34 CICERO DE AMrorrrA.

as to be able to endure that life, or from whom would not
solitude take away the enjoyment of all pleasurestt 88. So
the following is true—it used to be said, I think, by Archytas
of Tarentum, (as) Ι 113νο been told that our old men relate
that they have heard from other old men: ‘If anyone had
ascended to heaven, and had thoroughly seen the universe

· and the beauty of the stars, that admiration would have been

without pleasure to him 3 but it would have been most enjoy-
able if he had had anyone to whom to tell it.' Thus nature
likes nothing lonely, and always leans to some prop, so to
“ speak. This, too, gives the greatest delight (when found)
in the most attached friends.

XXIV. But although Nature, also, by so many signs shows
her wishes, requirementS, and wants, still we grow deaf, in
some way or other, and do not listen to her admonitions.
For the intercourse of friendship is varied and manifold, and
many causes of suspicion and offence are given, which it
is the part of the philosopher at one time to avoid, at another
to remove, and at others to endure. One especial occasion of
offence must be taken away, so that both usefulness and
loyalty may be preserved in friendship. For friends require
often both admonition and rebuke, and these must be received
in a friendly spirit, when they are made with goodwill.
89. But, somehow or other, what my friend (Terence) says in
his ‘Andria' is true: ‘Deference makes friends3 truth causes
hatred.' Truth is troublesome if indeed it gives birth to hatred,
which is the poison of friendship3 but deference is much more
troublesome, which, by giving indulgence to sins, allows
a friend to be hurried headlong to destruction. But the
greatest fault rests with the man who both scorns truth and
is driven by deference to ruin. So, in the whole of this
matter, precaution and care must be taken, first, that the
admonition be free from harshness3 secondly, that the rebuke
should be free from insult. But, in the case of deference,
since we gladly use Terence's word, let courtesy be present,
and let flattery, the helper of vice, be removed far off—flattery‚
which is not only not worthy of a friend, but not even of a
free man. For we live in one way with a tyrant, and
in another with a s1ee man. “⁷ss
