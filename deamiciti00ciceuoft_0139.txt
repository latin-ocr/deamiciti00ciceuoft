CICERO 1111 AMICITIA. 17
unwilling to oblige, with neglecting the claims of friendship.
But they who dared to make any and every request from a
friend, by the very request proclaimed that they would do
everything on behalf of a friend. Through their unceasing,
complaint‚ not only were intimacies commonly destroyed, but
also everlasting hatreds produced. These des tinies ,33 it were
hung over friendships in such numbers that, 113 said, it
seemed to him that it required not only wisdom, but also
good luck, to escape all of them.

XI. 3G.—Wherefore, let us first, if it pleases you, look
into this point, how far affection ought to go in friendship.
If Coriolanus had friends, ought they with Coriolanus to

. have borne arms against their country? WVhen Vecellinus

and Maelius were seeking to establish royal power, ought
their friends to have helped them? 37. As for Tib.
Gracchus, when he was harassing the state, we saw him
abandoned by Q. Tubero, and other friends of the same age
as himself. But when C. Blossius, of Cumae, a friend of
your house, Scaevola, came to me to ask pardon—for I was
present with the consuls Laenas and Rupilius at their de-
liberations—he brought forward this (as a) reason that I
should forgive him, viz., that 113 esteemed Tib. Gracchus
so highly that he thought he must do whatever 113 (Tib.)
wished. ‘Then,' said I, ‘(would you‘obey him) even if
he wished you to bring firebrands into the Capitol ‘l' ,
‘Never,’ said he, ‘could he have had that wish indeed3 but
if he had had that wish, Ι should have obeyed.' You see
how impious a speech it was. And, by heavens, he did
exactly aS, or even more than, he said; for he did not obey‚
but headed the rash infatuation of Tib. Gracchus, and made
himself not the companion but the leader of his frenzy.
So on account of this madness‚ frightened by the newly
established court of inquiry‚ he fied to Asia, betook himself
to the enemy, and paid a heavy and just penalty to the state.
It is therefore no palliation for your sin if you commit it for-¹⁴
the sake of a friend 3 for, as the belief about another's virtue
won the friendship, it is hard for friendship to remain if you
fall away from virtue. 38. Now, should we lay it down as
a right principle either to grant to friends whatever they

wish or to obtain from them whatever we wish‚ th)is prin-
