'74 CICERO DE AMICITIA. 'l

ferreus: there is undoubtedly a play upon words intended here ι
between ferreus and sermm see ξ 79, omnia praeclara rara. '

ῐ
cuique : compounded of cui and quc, not from quisquc. Ἰ

ξ 88. commemorare: notice the infin.⁷ not the participle commemo- J
ταπίεες hence we must translate ‘⁴ Ι have heard that our old men ’
relate,” not ‘⁴ I have heard our old men relating or relate.'’ The con-
struction is “quod audivi nostros senes commemorare, auditum ab ι
aliis senibus, dici solitum a Tarentino Archyta, ut opinor.'' Auditum ’
is in apposition to quod. With solitum supply esse.

in amicissimo quoque: the superl. adj. with quisquc often contains

the notion of in proportion lo: “to every one in proportion to his
friendliness or friendship.'’

CAP. XXIV. Advicc aud reproof must bc accepted with qood
humour. But thc advice should not bc qivcn with harshucss, nor the
reproof with insoleucc. A man should bc courteous bul not obsequious.
Truth is necessary, thouqh ‘hot always palatablc. A man should bc
sorry sor his faults ancl ylad at their correction, aud not vice versa.

eadem: nom. fem. agreeing with uatum, = “ also.”

quae ab ea monemur: lit.‚ “ what (things) we are admonished by
her‚” “the admonitions we receive from her”; quac, acc. of the
thing, being retained in the passive.

 

usus amicitiae: ‘⁴ intimacy‚'' “intercourse in friendship.’'

tum . . . tum . . . tum: “at one time, . . . at another, . . . at
another.⁷'

sapientis ε pred. gen.

sublevanda: another reading, subeunda = “must be undergone,'’
makes very good sense. Sublevanda is a variation on the preceding
word elevare = ‘⁶ must be removed‚’⁷—“ if the following cause of
offence must be removed‚’' ic. for the future people must take advice
and reproof without being offended.

haec: cle. advice and reproof‚ understood from mouendi et objur-
9au z.

ξ 89. in Andria: “ in the play of the Andrian girl.”

familiaris meus: Terence was an intimate friend of Laelius, and
belonged to the Scipionic circle; see supra, ξ 69.

ex ea nascitur odium: lit.‚ “ hatred is born of it.’⁷

obsequium: here used in a bad sense = ‘⁴ flattery '’ ; later on it is
used in a good sense = ‘⁴ respect,’⁷ “ deference‚’' ‘⁴ obedience.’'

in fraudem: fraus, besides meaning ‘⁶ deceit,’' also has the signifi-
cation of “injury,” “ ruin.’'

adsentatio vitiorum adjutrix: cp. supra, ἐξ 83 and 37.
