3. So at that time, when Scaevola had chanced to mention⁸

that very circumstance, he set forth⁴ to us0a conversation of
Laelius about sriendship, which Laelius had held with him
ani with his other son-in-law‚ C. Fannius, the son of
M. Fannius a few days after the death of Africanus. The-
opinions delivered in that discussion Ι committed to memory,
and have set them forth at my own discretiori 111 this book.
I have introduced· then] as speaking in person, as it were, so
that ‘said I’ or ‘says he’ might not be inserted too frequently,
and so that the discus ssion Omight appear to be held, as it
were, face to sace by speakers who are present.

4. Since you osten pleaded with me to write something
about friendship, the matter seemed to me worthy of the con-
sideration of all, and especially ⁷»orthy 01 0111· friendship, and
so, not unwillingly, I took pains to confer a benefit on many
at your request. ο But, as in the ‘Cato Major‚² which was
dedicated to you on the subject of old age, Ι introduced

to me a suitable personage to discuss those very points about
sriendship which Scaevola remembered to have been dis· ἶ
cussed by him. This kind of discourse, resting on the- ¹
authority of men of old, and they illustrious men, seems, ’
somehow, to possess more weight. Accordingly, when reading ,
my own uritings Ι am affected in such a way at times as to g
think that Cato is spe c>fal ing, and not my self. Ι
5. But as at that time Ι, an old man, wrote to an old j
man 011 01(1 ag 0, so in this book I, a very attached friend,
have written to a friend about iriendship. The speaker ’
then was Cato, than whom scarcely anyone at those times
was older, or possessed of more good sense3 now the speaker
011 friendship shall be Lzelius, who was both wise (for so he
was considered) and distinguished 101· the renown 01 his
friendship. Ι would like you to turn your attention away
from me for a little while, and to think that Laelius himself
is talking. C. Fannius and Q. Mucius come to their father-
