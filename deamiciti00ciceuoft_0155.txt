CICERO DE AMICITIA. ⁴ 33

ing after you have loved. But we suffer for our carelessness
in many things, and especially in loving and paying court to
our friends. For we put the cart before the horse in our
plans and do what is already done, which we are forbidden
from doing by the old proverb. For when we are already
entangled on this side and that, either by long habit or even
by duty, suddenly in the middle of the course some cause of
offence arises, and we break off the friendship.

XXIII. 86. XVherefore such great want of care in a
matter of the highest importance is still more to be blamed.
For friendship is the one thing in human affairs about the
expediency of which all unanimously agree. And yet, by
many, Virtue herself is despised and said to be a kind of
puffing and display3 many look down upon riches who
content themselves with little, and are delighted with meagre
food and dress 3 as to offices, with eagernessssfor which some
people, Ι know, are on fire, how many despise them In such
a way as to think nothing emptier 01· morertrifling! And
so with the other things which seem wonderful to some
people—-there are very many who consider them of no account.
About friendship all, to a man, have the same feeling, both
those who have betaken themselves to public life, and those
who are delighted by study and learning, and those who,
having laisum, do their own business, and, lastly, those who
have given themselves up entirely to pleasures. All feel that
without friendship there can be no life, if only they wish to live,
to some extent, like free men. 87. For, somehow or other,
friendship insinuates itself through the lives of all, nor does
it suffer any method of passing life to be without its
(presence). Nay, more3 if a man is of such a harsh and
savage nature as to fiee from and hate the assemblies of men,
just as was, we hear, a certain Timon Δία Athens, still, he could
not bear to abstain from seekiDg, in all directions, for some-
one to whom he may give vent to the venom of his harsh-
ness. And this question could best be dec-ided, if any such
thing as the following could happen, viz., that some God
should take us from this throng of men and place us any-
where in a desert, and there, providing abundant supplies of
everything which nature wants, were to take away the oppor-

tunity of seeing a man at all. Who would be so ἰῐοιὲ-Βθαπῢθά
