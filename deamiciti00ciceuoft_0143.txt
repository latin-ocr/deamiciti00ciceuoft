who are chiefly grieved at instances of injustice, the brave at
seebleness of spirit, the temperate at shocking crimes.
Accordingly, this is the characteristic of a well-ordered mind,
to feel both joy at good things and pain at the opposite.

48. therefore, if grief of the heart happens to a wise man .

—and it certainly does happen, unless we think that all seel-
ings of a man are rooted out of his mind-what reason is
there for us to remove friendship completely from life merely
to avoid taking up with some trouble on account of it 2 1 01·
when you have taken away the emotions of the mind, What
difference 1s there, Ι do not say between a beast ancl a man,
but between a man and a log, or a stone, or anything of the
same kind? For we mu'ffff‘noe listen to those people who
want to make virtue a certain hard and, as it were, iron
quality: nay, in many things, and especially in friendship,
it is tender and pliable, so that it is, as it were, expanded by
the good fortune of a friend and shrunk by his troubles.
Wherefore that pinch of pain which must often be endured
on behalf of a friend has not so much power that it removes
friendship from life, any more than that virtues are rejected
merely because they bring some anxieties and annoyances.

above, if any sign of virtue shine forth to which a similar mind
may incline and attach itself, when this happens, love neces-
sarily arises. 49. For what is so absurd as to be delighted
with many lifeless things, as with office, fame, house· building,
the clothing and adornment of the body, and not to be (18-
lighted to the full with a living being endowed with excel-
181188 811811 that it can either love or, so to speak, love 111
return. For nothing 18 more pleasant than the rewarding of
goodwill and the interchange of devotion and kind services.
250. What is we add also that which can be rightly added,
that there i , nothing which so entices and atti-acts anything
unto itself much as likeness attracts to friendship'l For
it will be assuredly granted that it is true that good men love
and attach to themselves good men, as if united to them by
relations-bip and nature. For there 18 nothing which is more
vager and greedy for things like itself than nature. WVhere-
fore, Fannius and Seaevola, let this be established, that, as I
think, between good men and good men there is as it were a.
