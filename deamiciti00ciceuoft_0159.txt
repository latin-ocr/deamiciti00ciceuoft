that fawning, however ruinous it may be, can injure no one >
except the man who takes it in and is delighted with it. So
it happens that the man who flatters himself, and is, most of
all, delighted with himself, is the man, most of all, to open
his ears to ssatterers. 98. Without doubt Virtue is a lover
of herself; for she knows herself best, and perceives how
lovable she is. But Ι 0111 not speaking now about virtue, -
but about supposed virtue. For there are not so many,
people endowed with virtue itself as are anxious to appear

is addressed to them moulded to theirltasta they consider
that false speech a testimony to their merits. This, then, is
no friendship, when one party is unwilling to hear the truth,

lously take care that the cunning and secret flatterer does 1101
wind himself in 3 for he is not very easily recognised, inas>
much as he often flatters even by opposing, and while pre—
tending to have a dispute, is wheedling you, and at the last
gives in and allows himself to be beaten, so that the man
who has been made game of may seegn to have been more
far-sighted. But what is more disgraceful than to be made
game Ο011 We must all the more take care against this hap-
pening to us. ‘How you have turned me round your finger
