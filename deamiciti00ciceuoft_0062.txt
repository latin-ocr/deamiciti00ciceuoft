58 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

praefuit: aor. of praeesse, “to be before or over,” hence “to head.’'
quaestione nova: “ by a new or special court of inquiry.’'

conciliatrix: Cicero is very fond of fem. nouns in -triam cp. ξ 89,
adsentatio, vitiorum adjutrix. In English it is often necessary to
turn the noun into a verb.

ξ 38. perfecta sapientia: the abl. of quality. Notice that this
construction cannot be used with a noun unless accompanied by an
adj. Thus homo summa virtute = ‘⁶ a man of the highest excellence‚'’
but homo virtute for ‘⁴ a man of excellence ‘' is not Latin.

vitii: partitive genitive depending on nihil.

qlims novit vita communis: lit.‚ “whom common life is acquainted
wit .’'

ex hoe numero Ξ eX horum numero-
ξ 39. bis una consules: 282 13.o. and 278 B.c.

censura: “censorship⁷’; one of the highest offices in Rome.
There were two Censors, and their duties were to fill up vacancies in
the senate, to hold a census of the citizens, and in some degree to
superintend the morals oi the state, and especially of the Equites.
They held office sor five years (a lustrum), but after 434 B.c. they
were obliged to complete their special duties in the first eighteen
months, but no new Censors were appointed until the expiration of
the five years. Aemilius Papus and Fabricius Luscinus were-Censors
in 278 ec.

Igitur: as a rule iqitur in Cicero, like autem, enim, que, quidem,
-ve‚ and vero, cannot stand at the beginning of a sentence. In Sallust
and later writers it is very often the first word of a sentence.

suspicari: see note ξ 12.

quemquam: not aliquem because the sentence is negative. The
differencelin meaning between quisquam and quispiam is scarcely
appreciab e.

t. q13i9d adtinet: lit.‚ “in what respect does it reach ⁷⁷ (to the ques-
ion .

rogatum: the acc„ prob. masc„ the subj. of roqare, rather than
nent„ agreeing with aliquid and object of royare.

minime: this superlative is rather awkward, as it cannot govern
another superl. acerrimus. From this word we must understand the
positive acer.

§4st oum.. ,tumz see ἓ 2.

de spatio curriculoque: a metaphor from the racc-course; spatium
= “ rane-course,” “track ”3 curriculum = (1) “ a race,'’ (2) “ a
tace-course‚” ‘⁴ racing ground.⁷’
