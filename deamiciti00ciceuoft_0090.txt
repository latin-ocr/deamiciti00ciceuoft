Cassia lex (ξ 41) : the law passed by the tribune, L. Cassius
Longinus, in 137 Bc, by which juries in crimina] cases were allowed
to vote by ballot. This Cassius was the author of the famous saying,
“ Cui bono? ’' = ‘⁶ For whose good? '² For another Cassia lex of the
consul Spurius Cassius, see s.v. Cassius.

Cassius (ξ 28) ; Spurius Cassius Viscellinus was consul in 502, 493,
and 486 13.c. During his third consulship, in 486 B.c., he proposed
his famous Agrarian Law (Cassia Lex), to divide the country of the
newly conquered Hernici equally among (1) the Hernici, (2) the Plebs,
and (3) the Latius. All parties were offended by this, and Cassius
was accused of aiming at the kingship, and was accordingly put to
death.

Cato (ξ 39); (1) Caius Porcius Cat0, grandson of Cato the Censor,
consul 13.c. 114, was condemned for corruption in his dealings with
J ugurtha. He was a friend and follower of Ti. Gracchus. (2) Marcus
Porcius Cato, sui-named the Censor, born 234 13.c., was quaestor under
Africanus in the war against Carthage3 was consul 13.st 195. He was
famous for his uprightness and temperance, exemplifieffiong other
things by the resignation with which he endured his son's untimely
death. Until very late in life he was strongly opposed to the intro-
duction of any‘lzind of Greek refinement into Roman character and
life, but before his death he withdrew this opposition. He was
censor in 184, and used the powers of his office with rigour and
severity. Hfflied about 150 13.c., after having lived to a good old
age. To him Cicero dedicated his treatise “ De Senectute,⁷’ otherwise

Coriolanus (gg 36, 42): Cn. Marcius, sui-named Coriolanus, from
his victory over Corioli 493 Bc, was a persistent opponent of the
Plebs. When there was a famine at Rome he resisted the proposal
to give corn to the people. The tribunes inflamed the people against
him, so that he was exiled in 491. He then joined Rome's bitterest
enemies, and by their help brought his native city within an ace of
destruction. His cruel purpose was averted by the entreaties of his
mother and wife. Sec Shakespeare's play of ‘⁴ Coriolanus.'’
