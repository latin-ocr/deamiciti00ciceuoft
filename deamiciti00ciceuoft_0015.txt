INTRODUCTION. 11

he was admitted into the College of Augurs, and in the
following year acted as proconsul and commanded the
province of Cilicia, where he conducted some successful
military operations.

It has been stated above that Cicero was a novus homo,
and as such would naturally belong to the democratic
party. From the date of his consulship, however, he seems
to have attached himself to the optimates, or aristocratic
party, and accordingly at the outbreak of the civil warin
49 Bo, after some hesitation, he joined Pompey, but sub-
sequently, after the battle of Pharsalia in 48 B.o.‚ he was
reconciled to Caesar. After the death of Caesar, 44 B.c.,
an open rupture ensued between him and Antony, and ·
Cicero gave vent to his anger and indignation in the famous
‘ Philippic Orations,’ fourteen speeches, the finest and most
renowned of which is the second. From the beginning
of 43 B.o. until the end of April Cicero was in the height
of his glory, but before the end of that year, in the pro-
scription that followed upon the formation of the trium-
virate, Cicero's name was, on the suggestion of Antony
which was not opposed by Octavianus, put in the list of those
doomed to immediate destruction. Soldiers were imme-
diately sent in pursuit, and although his attendants wished
to offer opposition‚ Cicero forbade them, and surrendered
to his pursuers, by whom he was immediately killed.

In the foregoing sketch no mention has been made of
Cicero’s philosophical works, which were both numerous
and important. His activity in this direction begins from
his exile in 57 B.o.; in 55 B.o. he produced the De Oratore,
in 54 B.c. the De Re Publica, and in 52 B.o. the De
Legyibus. This period of activity was followed by five years
(51 to 46 Bo) of comparative rest, but in 46 B.o. he wrote
the Hortensius or De Philosophia, a treatise now lost, in
addition to the Partitiones Oratoriae, the Brutus or De
Glari-s OratorzBus, and the Orator. During the years 45
and 44 B.o. he wrote the De Consolatione, on the occasion
of the death of his daughter Tullia; the Academica, an
account of the new Academic Philosophy, which main-
tained that there was no such thing as certainty—we must
be content with probability; the Disputationes Tusculanae,
