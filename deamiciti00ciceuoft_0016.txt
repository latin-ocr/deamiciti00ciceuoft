treating of happiness and inorality ; the De Natura
Deorum, the De Divinatione (on the subJect whether gods
communicate with men by means of augury, &c.), the Dc
Senectute, the De Amicitia, the Dc Fato (an account of
Fato and Freewill), the Paradooea (an account of certain
paradoxical opinions of the Stoics), the De Officiis, a treatise
on duty, and the Dc Finibus, on the Highest Good.

So far we have dealt with Cicero's speeches and philo·
sophical works. In addition to these must be mentioned
(1) his Letters, of which he wrote a vast number, andos
which more than 800 are preserved; (2) his poetica] works,
which were very poor in quality though not small in
quantity—his chief poem was written on the subject of his
consulship ; and (3) 1118 historical and miscellaneous works,
c.9. a prose account of his consulship, an account of his
policy immediately previous to his consulship, &c.

§2 The De Amicitia is a discussion in the form of a
conversation on the subject of Friendship. There are three
persons who take part in this discussion—O. Laelius and
his two sons-in-law, C. Fannius and Q. Mucius Scaevola.
Cicero, as described above, was constantly in the society of
Scaevola, and from him obtains an account of this conver-
sation. The chief interlocutor, C. LAELIUS, is appropriately
chosen on account of his long and celebrated intimacy with
the younger Scipio, and the scene is artistically laid in the
year 129 B.o.‚ just after Scipio's sensational death. O.
Laelius was born about 180 B.C. and greatly distinguished
himself as a statesnian, soldier, and orator, though he was
more of a statesman than a soldier, and more of an orator
than a statesman. He was a useful and successful officer
of Scipio's in the Third Punic War, was praetor in 145 B.c.,
when he conducted the military operations in Spain against
the powerful Viriathus with energy and success, and was
consul in 140 Β.0., after having been rejected in 141 B.o. in
spite of the support of Scipio. He was a leader of a large
literary circle which included the poet Terence ; 111 fact, he
is said to have written many parts of Terence’s plays.
