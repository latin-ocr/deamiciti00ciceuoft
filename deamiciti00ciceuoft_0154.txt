32 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

iieart he so combines with his own that he almost makes the
two hearts one.

XXII. 82. But most people perversely, not to say 51101110-
lessly, desire to have a friend of such a nature as they them-
selves cannot be, and wish to obtain from their friends what
they themselves do not give to them. It is, however, fair
for a man to be first good himself, and then to seek for
another like himself. In such men that firmness of friend-
511111 with which we have for a long while been dealing can
110 stren {theneth since men united by good feeling will in
the first place liave command over those passions to which
the 0111015 are slaveS, and, 10 1110 next place, they will rejoice
in fairness and justice, and the one will undertake every-
thing on belialf of the other, nor will the one ask from the
other anything but what is honourable and right3 nor will
they only pay attention to and love each other, but they will

fellowship with another. ἡ And among whomsoever this kind
of fellowship is, 11105, or shall be, theirs is to be considered
the best and happiest companionship 011 the path 10 the
highest good in nature. 81. Τ1115, Ι say, is the fellowship
in which 15 contained everything that men think should be
sought after: honour, fame, tranquillity and cheerfulness of
heart3 so that when these are present life is happy, and with-
out them it cannot be. And since this is the best and
greatest object, if we wish to attain it, we must devote our
attention to virtue, without which we cannot obtain either
friendship or any desirable blessing3 but if virtue is dis-
regarded, those who think they have friends then, and then
only, perceive they have made a mistake when some heavy
misfortune compels them to make the trial. 85. 11711010-
