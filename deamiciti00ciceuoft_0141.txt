C. Gracchus. Affairs which are creeping down the slope
to destruction, when they have once begun, go gliding on.
You see how great a corruption was caused in the ballot even
before, first by the law of Gabinius, and two years after-
wards by the law of Cassius. Ι already seem to see the
people separated from the senate, and affairs of the greatest
importance decided according to the will of the populace.
For more will learn how such measures are brought about
than how they are resisted. 42. But whither (are) these
(remarks tending)2 (I make them) because without comrades
no one makes any such attempt. We must therefore instruet
all good men that if, unaware‚ by some chance they become
involved in friendships of this kind, they are not to think
that they are so bound as not to depart from friends who are
committing a crime in some important public matter3 and a.
punishment must be appointed for the wicked‚ and, indeed, no⁸
less a one for those who have followed another than for those
who have been themselves the leaders in impiety. Who was
more renowned or more powersul in Greece than Themis—
tocles2 ¹But when (in his office of) general in the Persian
war he had freed Greece from slavery‚ and· yet had been
driven into exile on account of his unpopularity, instead of
enduringf-as he ought to have, the wrong inflicted upon him
by his ungrateful country, he d-id the same as Coriolanus
had done among us twenty years before„ For these men no
helper was found against their native country, and so each of
them committed suffifflefl-DVVherefore such an agreement
among wicked people not only ought not to be covered by
the plea of friendship, but ought rather to be punished by
every penalty, so tli'at no one should think it allowable to
follow a friend who is even bringing war against his native
country. Now this, considering the way matters have
begun to ge, will probably come about at some time or others
To me, moreover, it is a matter of no less anxiety κὼς-ιζ, tho
state will be like after my death than what it is like ‘co-day.
XIII. 44. So let this be established *sss the first law of
sriendship—to seek honourable things from friends, to do
honourable actions for the sake of friends, and not even to κ
wait until we are asked3 let zeal be always at hand,
