CICERO DE AMICITIA.

Ι. 1. Q. Mocms the augi ⁸ was wont to narrate many 31310
about O. Laelius, his father-⁸ in law, with good memory, and m
a pleasant style, nor to hesitate in all his conversation to eall
him wisc3 but Ι had been introduced to Scaevola by my
father when I had assumed the dress of manhood, on the
understanding that, as far as 'it was possible or permissible
for me, Ι should never depart from the old man's side.
Accordingly Ι committed to memory many szle discussions
of his, and many short and apt sayings, and was cager 1ο be-
come more learned, through his sl ill, in law. When he was
dead I betook myself to Scaevola the pontiff, who, Ι venture
to say, was absolutely the most distinguished in our state
for his talent and regard sor the right. But I will speak of
him at another time 3 now I return to the augur.

2. Ι remember much that he said on many occasions, and
especially that, as he was sitting at home on the semicircular
bench, in his customary manner, when a very few intimate
friends and myself were present with him, he fell into a con-
versation on a subject which happened at that time to be 111
the mouths of many people. You assuredly remember,
Atticus, and the more so because you were much 111 the
society of P. Sulpicius, how great was the surprise, or shall Ι
call it the complaint‚ of people when he, as tribune of the
plebs, with (feelings of) deadly hatred, was at variance
with Q. PompeiuS, who was then consul, and with whom he
had lived bound by the strongest ties of love.
