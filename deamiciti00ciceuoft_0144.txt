necessary feeling of goodwill, which is the source of friend-
ship established by nature. But this same good feeling
extends even to the people in general. For virtue is not
unkindly nor unserviceable nor arrogant, since it is accus-
tomed to protect even whole nations and to look after their
,interests in the best way, and this it would certainly not do
if it shrink from affection for the common people. 51. And,·
moreover, those who imagine friendships based on advantage
seem to me to take away the most lovable knot of friendship.
For it is not so much the advantage gained through a friend
as the love itself of the friend which delights us, and that
which has originated from a friend becomes pleasant only if
it has originated with zealous affection. And so far are
friendships from being cultivated on account of needineSS,
that those who, from their wealth, resources, and especially
by their virtue, in which is the greatest amount of protection,
stand least in need of another, are the most generous and the
most ready to do a kind service. Nay, Ι should rather think
that it is no advantage that nothing at all should at any time
be wanting to friends. For in what circumstances would
our zealous affection have thriven if Scipio had never, either
at home or abroad, been in want of my advice or my active

ance of everything‘l This, doubtless, is the life of tyrants,
in which there can be no saith, no affection, noxfirm reliance
on goodwill, in which everything is always an object of sus-
picion and anxiety, in which there is no place for friendship.
53. For who would love either the men he fears or the men
by whom he thinks himself feared. Yet they are courted
with a pretence (of friendsffip), although only sor a time;
and if perchance, as it generally happens, they fall, men
then perceive how poor in friends they were. As they say
