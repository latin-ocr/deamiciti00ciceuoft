CICERO DE AMrorTIA. 35

so that he cannot listen to what is true from a friend, all
hope of his welfare must be given up. For the following
remark of Cato, like many of his, is neat—‘ that bitter
enemies deserve better of certain men than those friends who
seem pleasant. For the former often speak the truth, the
latter never.’ And it is absurd that those who are admonished
do not feel that annoyance which they ought to feel, but do
feel that from which they ought to be free. For they are not
pained at having sinned, but they are annoyed at being
rebuked 3 whereas, on the contrary, they ought to be grieved
at the fault, and rejoice in its correction.

XXV. 91. Since, therefore, to give and receive advice is the
province of true friendship, and that the one should give it
sreely without harshness, the other receive it with patience
and without combating it, so we must consider that there
is no greater plague in friendship than fawning, wheedling‚
:ind flattery3 for this vice is to be branded by as many
names as you please, and is the characteristic of worthless
and deceitful men, who make all their speeches with the
view of securing your goodwill, none with a view to truth.
92. But while pretence in all things is depraved <for it
takes away our power of judging the truth, and adulterates
the latter), it is especially opposed to friendship. For it
blots out truth, without which the name friendship can have
no meaning, For since the force of friendship consists in the
fret that one mind, as it were, is made out of many, how can
this happen if not even in each individual a mind can
be found which is always one, and always the same, instead
of being fickle, changeable, and manifoldCt

93. For what can be so pliable or so erratic as the mind of
him who changes himself to suit not only the feeling and
wishes of another, but even to suit his look and 1]on
⁴ Some one says no, Ι say no3 he says yes, I say yes: in fine,
Ι have ordered myself to agree in everything,' as Terence
(whom I have just quoted) also says, but he (says it) in the
character of Gnatho. It is, however, a sign of light-minded-
ness to attach to one’s self‘ at all a friend of that kind.

94. But since there are many like the Gnathos‚ who are
higher in position, wealth, and reputation, their fiattery
is troublesome when to empty-headedness is added authority.
