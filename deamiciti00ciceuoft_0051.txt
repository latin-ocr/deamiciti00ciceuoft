ante tempus: by the Lex Annalisdfi-(J B.c.‚ it was enacted that no
one could hold certain offiees if he was under a certain age3 thus
27 years wffijhe-limit for the quaestorshi , zffijor the aedileship, 3-9
for the praetorship, and 434T0Tffig'cffi'sffighip. Scipio was consul in

eleeteTto each of these higlsffffi‘ees directly he attained the legal age.

suo tempore : this phrase generally means at the earliest age
allowed by law. In this ease as Scipio was 51 in 134, it must mean
at his proper age, 220. after he was 42 years old.

duabus urbibus: (1) Garthage‚ (2) Numantia in Spain.

paene sero: the N umantine war began in 143, and the nine years

preceding Scipio⁷s appointment to the command had been very
disastrous for Rome.

futura: it seems strange to say “ put an end to future wars,” ἀεὶ.
to wars which have no existence as yet, but the idea is easy to under-

stand, viz.„ to prevent future wars from arising by putting a final
end to the existing wars.

facillimis t facilis = “easy of access‚'’ “ easily spoken to ” ; hence
= “affable.”

liberalitate in sorores: τῖε. generosity in giving thern dowries.
ξ 12. fortuna, gloria: ablatives, not nominatives.

dictu: for the supine dictu see G. ξ 88. 3. The supine in u is
used after an adj„ as, facile, mirabile, and the supine in um is used
after verbs of motion, as venio visum = “ I come to see.‘’

suspicentur : from suspicor (dep), ‘⁴ to mistrust,” “ suspect ” ;
must be distinguished from suspicio, exi, -ectum, 3, “to look up to,’'
“ admire,” ‘⁶ esteem ” (ep. ξ 32). The participle of this verb, however,
suspectus, does mean ‘⁶ suspected '’ or “ suspicious.⁷' The noun sus-

picio, or suspitio, means “ suspicion.'' Most people suspected that
Garbo had murdered Scipio.

ex multis diebus quos in vita celeberrimos laetissimosque 1
viderit: Notice this idiom-in Latin the superlative adjective must Ι
be transferred into the relative clause. Thus, “ he sent me the most ¹
beautiful flower he had'’ must be turned into Latin by “Misit ad
me flores, quos habuit pulcherrimos.” “ Misit ad me pulcherrimos
