CICERO DE AMICITIA. ι

immortality, a thing that he by no means thought of, what
‹ud he not obtain that it was lawsul to man to wish for?
While still a youth he immediately, by his marvellous
merit, surpassed the highest hopes which his fellow—citizens
had already held about him when he was no more than a boy.
without ever being a candidate for the consulship he was
twice made consul, first before the proper age, and again, as
regards himself, at the proper age, but, as regards the state,
almost too late 3 and by the overthrow of two cities most
hostile to this empire he extinguished not only the then exist-
ing wars, but also future wars. What shall I say about his
affable manners, his filial respect to his mother, his generosity
to his sisters, his kindness to his relations. and his justice
towards all? You know them full well. How beloved he
was by the state is shown by the general grief at his funeral.
Then in what way could the addition 01 a few years have
helped him? Although old age is not burdensome, as Ι
remember Cato, in the year before his death, maintained in
argument with me and with Scipio, still, it takes away that
freshness of youth which Scipio even then enjoyed.

12. Wherefore his life, whether in respect of his fortune or
his fame, was such that it admitted of no addition, and the
quickness of his death took away the sense of dying, and,
you see, in this kind 01 death it is difficult to say what men
suspect. Still, we can say this with truth: out of the many
days that, in tho course 01 1113 1118, 118 saw most attended by
joyful crowds‚ that day was the most glorious to Scipio when,
after the rising of the senate, he was accompanied home in
the evening by the conscript fathers, the Roman people, and
Latin allies, 011 the day before he departed this life. So
that from such a high step of dignity he seems to have
reached a place among the Gods above rather than among
those below.

IV. 13. Ι (10 1101 agree with those who have lately begun
to argue that our souls die at the same time as our bodies,
and that everything is blotted out by death. The authority of
the ancignts has more weight with me, whether it be that of
our own· ancestors, who paid to the dead such ceremonious
ritcs as they assuredly would not have done if they had.
