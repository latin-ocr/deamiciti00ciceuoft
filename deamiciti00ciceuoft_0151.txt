complaint or even some reproach 3 and they do this the more
if they think they have something which theyffl say they
have done, in accordance with their sense of duty or friend-
ship, or at the expenditure of some trouble on their part.
Forsooth, the class of men who cast their kind services in your
teeth is hateful. The men on whom these services are con-
ferred should remember them; the men who conferred them

Ι ,ss should not recall the fact. 72. WVherefore, as those who

 

are superior ought to lower themselves in friendship, so ought
they in some way to raise up those whp are inferior. For
there are certain men who make friend-ships troublesome,
since they themselves think they are slig‘ited. This gene-
rally only happens to those who think 3:1⁴9 they actually
deserve to be slighted3 these men must ln releaefn‘l from
that idea, not only by words, but also by deeris. 73. You
must confer on each friend, first, as much as you can yourselt’ ’
accomplish3 and secondly, as much as he whom you would
love and help can endure. Why, not even you yourseli',
although you may surpass others in power, could carry
through all your friends to the highest honours 5 ae, for in-
stance, Scipio was able to make P. Rupilius consul, but
could not (make) his brother Lucius (consul). And even if
you could pass on any honour you please to another, you
must nevertheless consider what he is able to bear.

74. On the whole, friendships are to be decided on
when our natural powers and time of life have become
strengthened and settled 3 nor if any of us, at an early age,
were fond of hunting or balhplaying, those whom we
then loved (because they were) endowed with the same
taste (must we still) regard as intimate friends. For at
that rate nurses ancl tutors, by the right of old attachment,
will demand the greatest share of our goodwill. They, ot¹
course, are not to be neglected, but they must be regarded in
a certain different manner. Otherwise friendships cannot
last unaltered; for difference of character is followed by
difference of pursuits, the unlikeness of which cliseonnects
friendships. Nor is it on account of any other reason that
good men cannot be friendly with wicked or wicked with
good, except that there is between them the greatest diversity
that can be of character and. pursuits. For it can be laid.
