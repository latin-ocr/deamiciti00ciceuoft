many great advantages (as we have seen), but in the following
advantage it doubtless surpasses all things, viz„ it kindles in
sront the torch of good hope over the future, and does not
permit our spirits to be weakened or cast down. For he who
looks upon a true friend, looks upon, as it were, a copy of
himself. WVheresore, the absent are present, the poor have
„ plenty, the weak are strong, anch—what is harder to say,—the
dead are alive3 so great is the respect, recollection‚ and regret
in their friends which. accompanies them on their way.
Hence the death of the one party seems happy, and the life
of the other party praiseworthy. But if you take away from

hand, maintained, as was the fact, that he was Orestes! The
people stood up and cheered on (the occasion of) an imaginary
incident3 what do we think they would have done in real
