62 CICERO DE AMICITIA.

§49 animante praedito: animans, when referring to the lower
animals‚ is neut.; when referring, as here, to man, it is masculine.
animante is the abl. of the means after delectari, eo agrees with
animante.

ξ 50. profecto: pr5fecto (derived from pro and facto) :“f0r a deed
or fact”=“assuredly,” “ certainly,’⁷ must be distinguished from
profecto, the abl. of the perf. partic. of proficiscor, “to set out,'' and
from profecto, the abl. of the perf. partic. pass. of proficio, “I
advance,'’ “ accomplish.’'

ut: the use of ut here after verum esse shows that a consequence
is expressed. The acc. and infin. would have expressed a fact.

appetentius: present participles used as adjs„ and some adjectives
ending in -απ, take the genitive, e-gt. amans, capax, saqaae, eclaae, tenax,
cupiens, appetens, sapiens, patiens, prudens, potens, impotens.

similium: see G. ξ 277.
bonis inter bonos esse: “ good (men) have among good (men).''
necessariam: esse must be supplied here.

qui est fons: qui should strictly be quae, agreeing with its ante-
cedent benivolentia, but it is attracted into the gender of the predicate
fons. This attraction is found almost invariably3 it is quite the
exception to meet the strict logical gender.

inmunis: from in z “not,” and munus, “a service or duty''=
“free from services, or burdens ’‘ ; hence (1) “ inactive,’' (2) “ unser-
viceable,'’ (3) “ free from‚” “ exempt from.’'

quae. . . soleat: subj. expressing the reason. Distinguish con-
sulere aliquam, “to consult somebody‚'⁷ “ask his advice,” from con-
sulere alicui, “to take measures for some one’s benefit.'’

ξ 51. tantumque abest ut . . . ut . . . . The verb abest, abfuit,
δια, is always used impersonally by the best writers. The first ut
clause is explanatory of the impersonal subject, and the second ut
clause depends on tantum, and expresses the result. The predicate
of ii is “liberalissimi sint et beneficentissimi‚'’ and the pred. of qui
is “ indigeant.’'

Atque haut sciam an: Atque: “ and yet.'' Sciam is occasionally
found for the more common scio : it is to be explained as the apodosis
of a conditional sentence of which the protasis is not expressed (aq.
“ si quis ex me quaerat ’⁷).

opera: pl. from opus, -eris, n., “ a work ’' 3 opera is the abl. of opera,
-ae, f„ “ service‚” ‘⁶ pains‚” “ labour.” The pl. operae=“1abourers,”
“ workmen.’'

nec domi nec militiae: both domi and militiae are locative (cp.
Romae, dcc. = ‘⁶ at Rome ”). The locative case used to end in i, and
the old genitives of the first decl. used to be written ai.
