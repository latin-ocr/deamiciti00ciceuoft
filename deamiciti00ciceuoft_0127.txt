in-law aster the death of Africanus3 by them the conversation
is started3 Laelius rephes, and his whole discourze is on
friendship, 111 reading which you will recognise yourself,

ΙΙ. G. Faustina—What you say is right, Laelius; no man
was better or more famous than Africanus. But you ought to
think that the eyes of all are cast on you alone3 they both
call and think you wise. This title was given recently to
M. Cato, and we know that L. Acilius was called wise among
our fathers 3 but each of them 111 a somewhat different way,
Atilius because he was thought to be skilful 111 civil law, and
Cato because he had experience 111 many things. Many
instances used to be told of his wise foresight‚ firm behaviour,
and shrewd replies, both in the senate and in the forum 3
wherefore he had already, in his old ag„ e, the surname so to
speak, of the W ise.

7. But they think you wise in some different way, not ⁸
only by your nature and character, but also by your devotion
and culture, and not just as the common people‚ but as the
learned are accustomed to call a person wise. Such a one as
we have heard there was none in the other countries of
Greffze (for those who inquire into these things with more
tha‘n' usual accuracy do not count those who are called the
Seven among the number of the wise), and in Athens only
one, and he, indeed. judged by the oracle of Apollo to be
the wisest of all. This is the wisdom that they think is 111
γοα, that you look upon all your elements of happiness
as being stored in yourself, and that you consider man's
vicissitundes of less importance than virtue So they ask of
me, and Ι believe also of our friend here, Scaevola, in what
way you bear the death of Africanus3 arid they ask it the
more because when on the N ones last past we had come into
the gardens of D. Brutus the augur, in order to practise
as usual, you were not present, although you always used to
pay the most careful attention to that 0day and that duty.

8. Socer-‚ola ——WIany people do indeed inquire, C. Laelius,

f‘ as Fannius has said, but I answer that which Ι have noticed

 

—that you bear with moderatiori the pain y ou have incurred
through the death of a man who was not only very great, but
also your closest sriend3 but that you could not fail to be
moved, and to have so i'ailed would have been unlike your
